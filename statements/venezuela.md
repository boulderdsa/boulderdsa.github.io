title: Boulder DSA's Statement on Venezuela
---

*February 6th, 2019*

The Boulder County Chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America stands with the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela as it undergoes a new wave of imperialist attacks. On the 22nd of January 2019, the Trump administration encouraged Juan Guaidó to illegally declare himself president of Venezuela, setting into motion a coup attempt against the democratically elected government of Nicolás Maduro. This intervention is the most recent in a series of such actions taken by the United States against democracies in Latin America. Past victims of US intervention include Cuba, Guatemala, Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Nicaragua and Panama. The function of these past interventions was to secure private property for Capital, to steal wealth and power from the majority and place it in the hands of the minority. Rest assured this newest intervention shares the same goals and even facilitators as its predecessors, and is a symptom of the inherently undemocratic and unjust global economic system we call Capitalism.

Despite claims circulated in the media, this is not a nuanced issue. The United States plans to sacrifice human life in order to give companies like Chevron and Halliburton unrestricted access to Venezuelan resources. Anything other than total opposition to this intervention is tacit support for imperialism. There can be no equivocation. The Venezuelan people must decide the fate of their own nation.

Down with imperialism. Up with the Venezuelan people.

*¡Viva La Revolución Bolivariana!*
