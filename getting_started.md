## The Basics

### What is Boulder DSA?

Boulder DSA is a chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America, the largest socialist organization in the United States. We seek to build a mass movement and transfer power from the ruling elite to the working class, thereby gaining freedom and democratic control over all aspects of our society. We are a democratically run, volunteer organization that is led entirely by members like you. While we do endorse candidates for office, we are not a formal political party. 

### How do I get involved?

The easiest and most effective method to get involved in change is by joining a working group.  Working groups are smaller groups of DSA members with a specific focus.  There is no need to start with a huge commitment, find a committee that is engaging and works in your schedule.  Major working groups in Boulder DSA are Comms, Labor, Electoral, Medicare for All, and Housing Justice.  To get involved in a working group, join Slack as described below and ask when the next meeting is in the working group channel.

### How do I stay in touch?
One of the best ways to understand and engage in Boulder DSA activities is to get in the Boulder DSA Slack. Most of our discussion and calls for action take place here, and in general it is an effective tool for organizing, debating, and generally staying in touch. All you need to do is email proof of membership from national to either the new member coordinator, currently pgivens4915@gmail.com or boulderdsa@gmail.com and someone will send you an invite to our Slack. Another important way to stay abreast of what is happening in the chapter is to attend our general meetings listed on our [calendar]({% link calendar.md %}).  Lastly, our reading groups are a fantastic way to not only get to know your fellow comrades, but to improve your understanding of socialist theory.

## Getting in the Groove

### What do we do in our general meetings?
General is where we conduct our main business, as a democratic institution it is up to our members to run the organization and vote on issues, so we need you to bring your ideas here. Everyone is welcome to speak, although there are a few rules to keep in mind to keep meetings running smoothly.  Obviously the first and most general rule is to be respectful of others, but at some point you might hear that someone is taking “stack”. This means that if you want to speak on any point being discussed, simply raise your hand and the person taking stake will make sure you get an opportunity to speak in order.  Often conversation needs to be cut short due to time constraints, and the chair will announce that we need to “close stack,” this means that no more people can speak on the current issue so we can move on to the next order of business.  Meetings happen monthly and you can review when they are on our calendar, although we generally announce times and locations in Slack as well.  General meetings have an agenda that we attempt to stick to, and if you have something particular that you want to talk about, getting a topic on the agenda is as easy as asking a co-chair on slack.

### Core beliefs
We believe that our government and our workplaces should be run democratically by workers like us to meet the needs of our community, not to enrich billionaires, millionaires, and those who do their bidding. We oppose all forms of oppression and believe everyone has a right to healthcare, housing, a living wage, and more. We know the rich and powerful manipulate politicians, the law, and the economy to their benefit, and that only an organized movement of millions of working class people can create a society that works for all of us.


As you probably know, there are a myriad of philosophies on the left.  DSA is a big tent organization that has two fundamental principles and it is in the name : Democracy and Socialism.  As long as you believe those two things, that every person deserves an equal say in how they are governed, and for all people to have economic self-determination across society, then DSA is for you!

### Your role as a member
In order to win socialism, we must organize the working class and to organize the working class we must each take action in unison. The DSA is democratically managed, there is no waiting for someone to tell you what to do. While paying your dues is important, as no capitalist will fund their own destruction, we need people to commit time to advancing what we believe in and growing the party.  This is where you come in, join a working group today and get involved!

## Advanced DSA

### Boulder DSA structure
If you are curious about how we run our chapter, it is best to review our [bylaws]({% link resources/bylaws-updated.md %}).  Remember, these are currently how we run our organization, if you want to change it let’s bring it to a vote!

### Caucuses
As mentioned before, there are many different strategies within the left, and unsurprisingly there are many caucuses in DSA committed to advocating for their strategies.  If you are interested in creating change in DSA nationally, these are groups to get involved in.  [This article](https://socialistcall.com/2023/07/27/dsa-caucuses-guide-2023/) provides an overview of the different ones.

### Creating a working group
You might be passionate about changing something, but can not find a working group that seems like it is focused on that change.  That is where democracy comes into play; you can create your own working group!  All you need is 2 other comrades, and the ability to convince a majority of members in a general meeting (which should not be hard).  Check out Article VIII Section 1 of our bylaws for more details.

### Educating yourself 
Learning about socialism is a monumental task, especially when beginning.  The things that 
people refer to can be dense and alien, however there are a few easy ways to start.  The first step is often attending the reading group, where you can read alongside other comrades and help discover a text together.  More experienced members can help you understand the lingo in a non judgemental space.  Don’t let that stop you from diving in yourself however, Bread and Roses, a DSA Caucus has assembled [a good reading list](https://breadandrosesdsa.org/reading-list/), and if you are a learner who prefers to watch here is a good [video introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fpKsygbNLT4), and if you prefer to listen, [Revolutionary Left Radio](https://revolutionaryleftradio.libsyn.com/) is a solid way to start. Additionally the DSA has released a [program for 2024](https://2024.dsausa.org/) that describes what it is we fight for and why.
