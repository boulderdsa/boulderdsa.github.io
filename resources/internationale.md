Stand up, all victims of oppression,  
For the tyrants fear your might.  
Don't cling so hard to your possessions,  
For you have nothing if you have no rights.  
Let racist ignorance be ended,  
For respect makes the empires fall.  
Freedom is merely privilege extended  
Unless enjoyed by one and all,  

**Chorus**:  
So come brothers and sisters,  
For the struggle carries on—  
The Internationale  
Unites the world in song.  
So comrades, come rally,  
For this is the time and place:  
The international ideal  
Unites the human race!  

Let no one build walls to divide us,  
Walls of hatred nor walls of stone.  
Come greet the dawn and stand beside us,  
We'll live together or we'll die alone.  
In our world poisoned by exploitation,  
Those who have taken, now they must give,  
And end the vanity of nations.  
We've but one Earth on which to live!  

And so begins the final drama,
In the streets and in the fields.  
We stand unbowed before their armor,  
We defy their guns and shields.  
When we fight, provoked by their aggression,  
Let us be inspired by like and love,  
For though they offer us concessions,  
Change will not come from above!
