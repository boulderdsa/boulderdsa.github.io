![Signs made by Boulder DSA members](/images/mayday-signs.jpg){:.img-responsive .center-block width="100%"}

Boulder DSA is a local chapter of the [Democratic Socialists of America](http://www.dsausa.org), the largest socialist organization in the US. We are a “big tent” organization: our members come from many backgrounds with many points of view, but we all agree on one thing—unchecked capitalism has created a society that puts corporate profit above human rights, and we are committed to changing that through direct, grassroots action.

Our chapter in Boulder and Broomfield prioritizes the following issues:

* Housing Justice: Members of our chapter successfully organized and passed the [No Eviction Without Representation](https://www.newrboulder.com/) ballot measure.
*	Building Labor Power: Our members are active in local unions and our chapter coalitions to support local labor whenever possible.
*	Political Education: We have a long-standing reading group that reads theory, history, science fiction, and everything in between.
*	Creating a Left Coalition: We work with groups throughout Boulder and Broomfield County to create a broad coalition of left and left-leaning housing, mutual aid, immigrant rights, and anti-war organizations. 
*	Fighting Alienation: Our chapter is a community that brings together students and workers from every industry. Together, we build solidarity across a number of issues and fight the alienation of living in a capitalist society.     


Boulder DSA employs many tactics, including legislative, protests, and direct community action. We don’t believe any one alone is sufficient for changing our society. If you want to fight back against rule by the rich and oppression and scapegoating of the vulnerable, [join us today](/contact/)!
